# LinearRegression-PredictingDisease
### Your goal is to predict the number of dengue cases that are going to be found in given city, year, week_of_year and some extra features of weather.
There are two cities, “San Juan” and “Iquitos” with test data for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively. The data for each city have been concatenated along with a city column indicating the source: 'sj' for San Juan and 'iq' for Iquitos. Throughout, missing values have been filled as NaNs.
### Download data from:
1. https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivendata/data/44/public/dengue_features_train.csv
2. https://s3.amazonaws.com/drivendata/data/44/public/dengue_labels_train.csv
### Steps we followed: 
Task 1: Do all the sorts of pre-processing required along with proper analysis and make data ready for models.

Task 2: You are allowed to use only linear regression, report the mean absolute error on the test data (you are free to use all sorts of feature conversion techniques, you can add/delete/modify features as you want) Performance metric Mean absolute error
### Type of problem:
